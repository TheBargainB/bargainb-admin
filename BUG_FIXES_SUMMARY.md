4. **Phone Input Component Enhancement**
   - Created comprehensive translation system for phone input
   - Added translated placeholders, labels, and validation messages
   - Supports all 6 languages with proper terminology

5. **UI Elements Translation**

- **Outer orbit bees**: 24px → **36px** (+50% increase)
- **Top-right orbit**: 20px → **30px** (+50% increase)
